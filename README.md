# Gazebo_ROS_Simulations
This ROS workspace is built for implementing and testing applications of robot arms related to robot manipulations, motion planning and vision-based control. A simulation environment has been constructed using Gazebo, provided rich contents to simulate related experimental setups, such as depth cameras, Robotiq grippers, AR markers, force sensors as well as workbenches, targets and reference objects.

## Tasks
Although the simulation environment is designed for all variety of tasks of manipulators, there are several tasks in the package "ur5_visual_servos" that can serve as examples:

1. Robot homing process
2. Simple pick and place task
3. 3D point-target visual servoing
